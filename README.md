## Getting started

Before running the client please set up the [backend server](https://github.com/davzhardy/bio_assess_server)

Please ensure the PORT variable in the ApiService.js file is consistent with the PORT variable specified on the backend server.

After the server is up and running, in the project directory run 

```
npm install 
npm start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the client.
